Join us at aka.ms/autogen-discord . (11/14/24) ⚠️ In response to a number of asks to clarify and distinguish between official AutoGen and its forks that created confusion, we issued a clarification statement . (10/13/24) Interested in the standard AutoGen as a prior user? Find it at the actively-maintained AutoGen 0.2 branch and autogen-agentchat~=0.2 PyPi package. (10/02/24) AutoGen 0.4 is a from-the-ground-up rewrite of AutoGen. Learn more about the history, goals and future at this blog post . We’re excited to work with the community to gather feedback, refine, and improve the project before we officially release 0.4. This is a big change, so AutoGen 0.2 is still available, maintained, and developed in the 0.2 branch . Join us for Community Office Hours We will host a weekly open discussion to answer questions, talk about Roadmap, etc. AutoGen is an open-source framework for building AI agent systems.\\nIt simplifies the creation of event-driven, distributed, scalable, and resilient agentic applications.\\nIt allows you to quickly build systems where AI agents collaborate and perform tasks autonomously\\nor with human oversight. Key Features API Layering Quickstart Roadmap FAQs AutoGen streamlines AI development and research, enabling the use of multiple large language models (LLMs), integrated tools, and advanced multi-agent design patterns. You can develop and test your agent systems locally, then deploy to a distributed cloud environment as your needs grow. Key Features AutoGen offers the following key features: Asynchronous Messaging : Agents communicate via asynchronous messages, supporting both event-driven and request/response interaction patterns. Full type support : use types in all interfaces and enforced type check on build, with a focus on quality and cohesiveness Scalable & Distributed : Design complex, distributed agent networks that can operate across organizational boundaries. Modular & Extensible : Customize your system with pluggable components: custom agents, tools, memory, and models. Cross-Language Support : Interoperate agents across different programming languages. Currently supports Python and .NET, with more languages coming soon. Observability & Debugging : Built-in features and tools for tracking, tracing, and debugging agent interactions and workflows, including support for industry standard observability with OpenTelemetry ↑ Back to Top ↑ API Layering AutoGen has several packages and is built upon a layered architecture.\\nCurrently, there are three main APIs your application can target: Core AgentChat Extensions Core Installation Quickstart The core API of AutoGen, autogen-core , is built following the actor model .\\nIt supports asynchronous message passing between agents and event-based workflows.\\nAgents in the core layer handle and produce typed messages, using either direct messaging,\\nwhich functions like RPC, or via broadcasting to topics, which is pub-sub.\\nAgents can be distributed and implemented in different programming languages,\\nwhile still communicating with one another. Start here if you are building scalable, event-driven agentic systems. AgentChat Installation Quickstart The AgentChat API, autogen-agentchat , is task driven and at a high level like AutoGen 0.2.\\nIt allows you to define conversational agents, compose them into teams and then\\nuse them to solve tasks.\\nAgentChat itself is built on the core layer, but it abstracts away much of its\\nlow-level system concepts.\\nIf your workflows don\\'t fit into the AgentChat API, target core instead. Start here if you just want to focus on quickly getting started with multi-agents workflows. Extensions The extension package autogen-ext contains implementations of the core interfaces using 3rd party systems,\\nsuch as OpenAI model client and Azure code executors.\\nBesides the built-in extensions, the package accommodates community-contributed\\nextensions through namespace sub-packages.\\nWe look forward to your contributions! ↑ Back to Top ↑ Quickstart Python (AgentChat) First install the packages: pip install \\' autogen-agentchat==0.4.0.dev11 \\' \\' autogen-ext[openai]==0.4.0.dev11 \\' The following code uses OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o model and you need to provide your\\nAPI key to run.\\nTo use Azure OpenAI models, follow the instruction here . import asyncio from autogen_agentchat . agents import AssistantAgent from autogen_agentchat . ui import Console from autogen_agentchat . conditions import TextMentionTermination from autogen_agentchat . teams import RoundRobinGroupChat from autogen_ext . models . openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient # Define a tool async def get_weather ( city : str ) -> str : return f\"The weather in { city } is 73 degrees and Sunny.\" async def main () -> None : # Define an agent weather_agent = AssistantAgent ( name = \"weather_agent\" , model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient ( model = \"gpt-4o-2024-08-06\" , # api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\", ), tools = [ get_weather ],\\n    ) # Define termination condition termination = TextMentionTermination ( \"TERMINATE\" ) # Define a team agent_team = RoundRobinGroupChat ([ weather_agent ], termination_condition = termination ) # Run the team and stream messages to the console stream = agent_team . run_stream ( task = \"What is the weather in New York?\" ) await Console ( stream ) asyncio . run ( main ()) C# The .NET SDK does not yet support all of the interfaces that the python SDK offers but we are working on bringing them to parity.\\nTo use the .NET SDK, you need to add a package reference to the src in your project.\\nWe will release nuget packages soon and will update these instructions when that happens. git clone https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git\\ncd autogen\\n# Switch to the branch that has this code\\ngit switch staging-dev\\n# Build the project\\ncd dotnet && dotnet build AutoGen.sln\\n# In your source code, add AutoGen to your project\\ndotnet add <your.csproj> reference <path to your checkout of autogen>/dotnet/src/Microsoft.AutoGen/Core/Microsoft.AutoGen.Core.csproj Then, define and run your first agent: using Microsoft .

We will continue to accept bug fixes and minor enhancements to this version. AutoGen 0.4 - This is the first release of the new architecture. This release is still in preview . We will be focusing on the stability of the interfaces, documentation, tutorials, samples, and a collection of built-in agents which you can use. We are excited to work with our community to define the future of AutoGen. We are looking for feedback and contributions to help shape the future of this project. Here are some major planned items: More programming languages (e.g., TypeScript) More built-in agents and multi-agent workflows Deployment of distributed agents Re-implementation/migration of AutoGen Studio Integration with other agent frameworks and data sources Advanced RAG techniques and memory services ↑ Back to Top ↑ FAQs What is AutoGen 0.4? AutoGen v0.4 is a rewrite of AutoGen from the ground up to create a more robust,\\nscalable, easier to use, cross-language library for building AI Agents.\\nSome key features include asynchronous messaging, support for scalable distributed agents,\\nmodular extensible design (bring your own agents, implement behaviors however you like),\\ncross-language support, improved observability, and full typing integration.\\nIt is a breaking change. Why these changes? We listened to our AutoGen users, learned from what was working, and adapted to fix what wasn\\'t.\\nWe brought together wide-ranging teams working on many different types of AI Agents\\nand collaborated to design an improved framework with a more flexible\\nprogramming model and better scalability. Is this project still maintained? We want to reaffirm our commitment to supporting both the original version of AutoGen (0.2) and the redesign (0.4) . AutoGen 0.4 is still work-in-progress, and we shared the code now to build with the community. There are no plans to deprecate the original AutoGen anytime soon, and both versions will be actively maintained. Who should use it 0.4? This code is still experimental, so expect changes and bugs while we work towards a stable 0.4 release. We encourage early adopters to\\ntry it out, give us feedback, and contribute.\\nFor those looking for a stable version we recommend to continue using 0.2 I\\'m using AutoGen 0.2, should I upgrade? If you consider yourself an early adopter, you are comfortable making some\\nchanges to your code, and are willing to try it out, then yes. How do I still use AutoGen 0.2? AutoGen 0.2 can be installed with: pip install autogen-agentchat~=0.2 Will AutoGen Studio be supported in 0.4? Yes, this is on the roadmap .\\nOur current plan is to enable an implementation of AutoGen Studio\\non the AgentChat high level API which implements a set of agent functionalities\\n(agents, teams, etc). How do I migrate? For users familiar with AutoGen, the AgentChat library in 0.4 provides similar concepts.\\nWe are working on a migration guide. Is 0.4 done? We are still actively developing AutoGen 0.4. One exciting new feature is the emergence of new SDKs for .NET. The python SDKs are further ahead at this time but our goal is to achieve parity. We aim to add additional languages in future releases. What is happening next? When will this release be ready? We are still working on improving the documentation, samples, and enhancing the code. We are hoping to release before the end of the year when things are ready. What is the history of this project? The rearchitecture of the framework started with multiple Microsoft teams coming together\\nto address the gaps and learnings from AutoGen 0.2 - merging ideas from several predecessor projects.\\nThe team worked on this internally for some time to ensure alignment before moving work back to the open in October 2024. What is the official channel for support? Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.\\nUse GitHub Discussions for general questions and discussions. Do you use Discord for communications? We are unable to use the old Discord for project discussions, many of the maintainers no longer have viewing or posting rights there. Therefore, we request that all discussions take place on https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/discussions/ or the new discord server . What about forks? https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/ remains the only official repo for development and support of AutoGen.\\nWe are aware that there are thousands of forks of AutoGen, including many for personal development and startups building with or on top of the library. We are not involved with any of these forks and are not aware of any plans related to them. What is the status of the license and open source? Our project remains fully open-source and accessible to everyone. We understand that some forks use different licenses to align with different interests. We will continue to use the most permissive license (MIT) for the project. Can you clarify the current state of the packages? Currently, we are unable to make releases to the pyautogen package via Pypi due to a change to package ownership that was done without our involvement. Additionally, we are moving to using multiple packages to align with the new design. Please see details here . Can I still be involved? We are grateful to all the contributors to AutoGen 0.2 and we look forward to continuing to collaborate with everyone in the AutoGen community. ↑ Back to Top ↑ Legal Notices Microsoft and any contributors grant you a license to the Microsoft documentation and other content\\nin this repository under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ,\\nsee the LICENSE file, and grant you a license to any code in the repository under the MIT License , see the LICENSE-CODE file.
